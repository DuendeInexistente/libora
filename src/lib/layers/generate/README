This directory includes a Python script that is used to generate
an Expat based parser/validator for OpenRaster stack description
XML. Although it was started as a generic parser generator it
(at the moment) lacks some important features. This is why I have
decided to temporarly publish the entire code in the libora 
repository I/anyone finds this stuff interesting a separate project
can be started and this code can be removed from the repository.

If anyone wonders why a parser generator here are some of my reasons
why I have decided to go write one:
 * A full-blown validator that uses a Relax NG, DTD or XSD description
   has to parse that description therefore introducing some overhead and
   usually depends on even more aditional libraries. The idea of libora
   is that it is small, fast and has as few dependencies as possible
 * Expat is a nice, small and fast stream oriented parser for XML documents. 
   It does not however provide validation or any high end functionality.
 * Writing custom Expat handlers by hand is extremely dull and error
   prone. A generator can do much better job here.

The original idea was to create a program that parses an XML description
file like Relax NG, stores the definition in Python objects and leaves 
the rest to Cheetah template engine to produce output code. The current
implementation does not parse anything (instead Python objects are initialized
explicitly) and can only produce an Expat parser code for C. It also supports
a very basic subset of the XML definitions (that I required for libora).
Everything is extendible though.

As mentioned, the script requires Cheetah template engine installed.
You can get it here: http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/. To run the generator
type: "python orastack.py" into the terminal. This will generate/update
stack_parser.c and stack_parser.c in the layers directory.
