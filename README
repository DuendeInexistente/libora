libora is meant to be a reference library to help implementation of the
OpenRaster file format: http://openraster.org

Status: Immature, under development
License: Simplified BSD (2 clause)

== CONTACT ==
create@lists.freedesktop.org

== INSTALLING ==
libora uses the cmake build system. To install:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/installation/path .
make
make install

== TODO ==
 - Provide pkg-config files for the library
 - Don't put a white background on rendered images
 - Add ability to open a FILE*, file descriptor and/or memory buffer
 - Add "stack" API for going backwards through the layers
 - Allow one to get layer information (like opacity, position) without reading out the layer data
 - Support incremental rendering of the full-document image
 - Provide a ora2png binary that allows one to convert OpenRaster files to PNG

Proposed style/correctness/best-practices fixes
 - Get rid of _ prefixed symbols, they are reserved for C implementations
 - Use enums for enumerated values (ex: ORA_FORMAT_*)
 - Don't typedef standard types, it typically gives no benefit
 - Use a distinct naming convention for types, it increases readability. Suggestion: CamelCasedType
 - Don't typedef things to void*, it reduces type safety (ex: ORA)
 - Put external code outside the main source directory (ex: oratool, zip, parser generator). Rename src to libora?
 - Don't use a nested directory structure when there only a few files in each dir
 - Consolidate the different ora_document* types, the duplication is error prone
 - Don't use positional arguments for individial data where the amount of data might change (ex: ora_layer_write())
 - Get rid of the ORA_FILE_READ_NO_STACK, just read the stack on-demand when neccesary (and preferably only the parts neccesary)
